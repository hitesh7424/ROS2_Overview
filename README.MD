# ROS Fundamentals

## What is ROS?

**ROS (Robot Operating System)** is an open-source robotics software framework that provides tools, libraries, and conventions for developing complex robotic systems. Launched in **2007**, ROS enables scalable applications for various robots, from household devices to advanced space exploration systems like NASA's Curiosity rover.

## Why Use ROS?

- **Integrated Framework**: Combines debugging, simulation, and visualization tools into a single platform.
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted by robotic engineers for developing intelligent robots, with significant momentum in industrial applications.
- **Community-Driven**: An active open-source community fosters continuous improvements and innovations.

## ROS 1 vs. ROS 2

- **Commercial Focus**: ROS 1 lacked features like security and network reliability, while ROS 2 addresses these with enhanced performance in challenging networking conditions.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: ROS 2 runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS, facilitating integration with cloud services like AWS.
- **Common Libraries**: All client libraries share a common implementation in C, known as **rcl**.

### Version Support

- **ROS Melodic**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **ROS Noetic**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Learning Roadmap

1. Basics of robotics and operating systems
2. Introduction to ROS 1 and its fundamentals
3. Transitioning to ROS 2
4. Learning ROS 2 concepts using Python and C++
5. Understanding the ROS 2 ecosystem
6. Testing and developing mobile robots
7. Simulation and debugging techniques

## Key Terminology

- **Nodes**: Independent processes that communicate within the ROS framework.
- **Topics**: Publish/subscribe model for message exchange between nodes.
- **Services**: Request/response model for task execution between nodes.
- **Actions**: Client-server model for long-running tasks with feedback.
- **Parameter Server**: Centralized storage for global parameters accessible by all nodes.

## Conclusion

ROS has transformed robotics by providing a flexible, modular, and open-source framework that accelerates robotic system development. Its extensive tools and libraries simplify complex tasks, making it essential for advancements in autonomous systems, robotics research, and industrial automation.
